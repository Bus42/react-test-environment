# React Test Environment
This is here so I don't have to run `create-react-app anotherfrigginapp` every time I want to test out an idea or flesh out a component. Feel free to play around or contribute!

## Request Component
The first component I've built for this test environment!
I'm building this to create a template component that I can reuse in any React application that I'm building. The idea is to only have to change the base_url, resources, and parameters, the rest is ready to go including data rendering and error handling so I can get right to work on manipulating the data instead of writing 100+ lines of code to do the exact same thing any other XMLHTTPRequest would do.


Thanks for checking out my stuff,
